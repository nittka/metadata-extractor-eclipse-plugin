# metadata-extractor-eclipse-plugin
A simple Eclipse plugin wrapper for https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor.

Rather than packaging the metadata-extractor jar with each new version of your plugin, you can declare a dependency to the wrapper plugin, which simply exports all packages.

The jars are from maven central.
